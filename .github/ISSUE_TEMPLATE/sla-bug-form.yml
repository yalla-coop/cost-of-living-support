      description: "\n
        **priority-1 issues** are **urgent** and require immediate attention due to their severe impact on the system's functionality, security, or stability. These bugs may cause crashes, data loss, security breaches, or other critical issues that prevent the system from functioning as intended. \n
    \n
    \n
        **priority-2 issues** are of **high priority** and need to be addressed within the next week. While they may not have the same level of urgency as critical bugs, high-priority bugs render a core feature unusable, can impact the user experience, cause major functionality disruptions, or result in data inconsistencies. \n
    \n
    \n
        **priority-3 issues** have a **normal or moderate** level of priority. Most of your issues will probably fall under this category. They need to be resolved within the month but are not as severe as critical or high-priority bugs. These bugs may affect specific functionalities or impact a subset of users, but they do not hinder the core functionality of the system. \n
    \n
    \n
        **priority-4 issues** are of **lower priority** and typically encompass minor issues, cosmetic defects, or non-critical enhancements. These bugs do not significantly impact functionality or user experience and can be deferred to a later stage or addressed during regular maintenance cycles. Minor cosmetic issues, small copy or styling issues all fall under this category. \n
